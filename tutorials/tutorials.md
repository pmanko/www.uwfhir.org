# Overview
The UW FHIR Workshop Tutorials will take place on Sunday, September 23 in room C123 in [Building C](https://www.uwmedicine.org/research/sites-facilities/slu/maps-contacts) at the UW Medicine - South Lake Union Research Hub. 

The address of the location is [850 Republican St, Seattle, WA 98109](https://goo.gl/maps/Z3wTR9A5iVP2). 

The tutorials will consist of two sessions - one in the morning, one in the afternoon - with a lunch break between. 

The morning session will introduce FHIR, FHIR Resources, and the ClinFHIR tool. 

The afternoon session will start with a walk-through for using FHIR APIs to retrieve FHIR resources needed for calculating the [Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framingham_Risk_Score).

For the rest of the afternoon, participants will choose from 3 different tracks and work colaboratively in small teams on more advanced projects. 
We'll aim to create diverse teams that include at least one clinician and one developer.
