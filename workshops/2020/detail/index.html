                                FHIR can help facilitate the entire data lifecycle (i.e., action to data to information to knowledge and back to action). This session will demonstrate this through two major initiatives that focus on various parts of the data lifecycle:

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Adapting Clinical Guidelines for the Digital Age – developing computable knowledge through an agile, integrated process using the (Clinical Practice Guidelines) CPG-on-FHIR implementation guide</li>


                                    <li>Making EHR Data More Available for Research and Public Health (MedMorph) – improving how to get data from different EHR systems without posing additional burden on health care providers through a reliable, scalable, generalizable, configurable, interoperable method (i.e., reference architecture) to get EHR data for multiple public health and research use cases</li>

                            In my presentation, I will discuss what we hear from researcher needs about better integration with academic health systems for the purposes of investigational studies. I will discuss the importance of strategy around governance, resources and technical capability. I will also discuss how the UW is preparing to be more collaborative and supportive of investigators who are innovation leaders and require health system support to be successful. I'll touch on national efforts and raise a challenge to better support investigation and the opportunity.</td>

                            Shareable clinical decision support artifacts that leverage balloted and adopted FHIR resources (for instance, US Core or USCDI) are limited by the level of support provided (and conditions on access) to those FHIR resources in commercial EHRs. In addition, the current standards outlined by US Core and USCDI leave gaps, some more significant than others, that lead to challenges in implementation. EHR vendor support of FHIR services is variable in breadth, depth and quality, and bridging these gaps can sometimes be costly for customers. The ONC final rule has provided some motivation for EHR vendors to expand and update the FHIR support they provide for some data elements. We will discuss some challenges and recommendations focused on this gap between what is specified, what is allowed and what is implemented.</td>

Dr. Marcial serves as the task lead on the development, implementation and piloting of the patient- and provider-facing SMART on FHIR based clinical decision support applications for ambulatory practice use that serve as the core components of the CDS4CPM project. The purpose of the CDS4CPM project is to develop, implement, disseminate, and evaluate clinical decision support (CDS) in the area of chronic pain management. More specifically, AHRQ is interested in CDS that is delivered through both clinician- and patient-facing channels and is interoperable and publicly-shareable. This project is leveraging the CPG-on-FHIR work, the Opioid IG work, SMART, FHIR and related tools and technologies to implement these CDS artifacts in two health systems.</th>

                                    I began my career with a strong interest in computer engineering, which I studied both in undergraduate and graduate school, and for the next six years was a principal in two small technology startups. I developed an interest in medicine and completed medical school at the UC Berkeley and UCSF Joint Program. My MS thesis combined engineering and medicine to examine the heart’s electrical activity during cardiac arrest. I completed a residency in Emergency Medicine at the University of Arizona, with a brief stint as a Registrar at the Royal Brisbane Hospital, Queensland, Australia. I came to UW as a board certified ED physician, practiced for a few years, and completed a postdoctoral fellowship in Medical Informatics (NIH/NLM F38 Applied Medical Informatics) with Dr. Jim Brinkley. I joined the School of Nursing faculty in 2005 and have been happily pursuing my interests across health informatics, across Nursing, Medicine, and Public Health, since that time.

                            Shareable clinical decision support artifacts that leverage balloted and adopted FHIR resources (for instance, US Core or USCDI) are limited by the level of support provided (and conditions on access) to those FHIR resources in commercial EHRs. In addition, the current standards outlined by US Core and USCDI leave gaps, some more significant than others, that lead to challenges in implementation. EHR vendor support of FHIR services is variable in breadth, depth and quality, and bridging these gaps can sometimes be costly for customers. The ONC final rule has provided some motivation for EHR vendors to expand and update the FHIR support they provide for some data elements. We will discuss some challenges and recommendations focused on this gap between what is specified, what is allowed and what is implemented.</td>

More specifically, AHRQ is interested in CDS that is delivered through both clinician- and patient-facing channels and is interoperable and publicly-shareable. This project is leveraging the CPG-on-FHIR work, the Opioid IG work, SMART, FHIR and related tools and technologies to implement these CDS artifacts in two health systems.</td>

                                    I began my career with a strong interest in computer engineering, which I studied both in undergraduate and graduate school, and for the next six years was a principal in two small technology startups. I developed an interest in medicine and completed medical school at the UC Berkeley and UCSF Joint Program. My MS thesis combined engineering and medicine to examine the heart’s electrical activity during cardiac arrest. I completed a residency in Emergency Medicine at the University of Arizona, with a brief stint as a Registrar at the Royal Brisbane Hospital, Queensland, Australia. I came to UW as a board certified ED physician, practiced for a few years, and completed a postdoctoral fellowship in Medical Informatics (NIH/NLM F38 Applied Medical Informatics) with Dr. Jim Brinkley. I joined the School of Nursing faculty in 2005 and have been happily pursuing my interests across health informatics, across Nursing, Medicine, and Public Health, since that time.
