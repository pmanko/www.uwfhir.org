Laura Haak Marcial is a Health Informaticist at RTI International and Associate Project Director for the AHRQ-funded Clinical Decision Support for Chronic Pain Management (CDS4CPM) project. Dr. Marcial serves as the task lead on the development, implementation and piloting of the patient- and provider-facing SMART on FHIR based clinical decision support applications for ambulatory practice use that serve as the core components of the CDS4CPM project. The purpose of the CDS4CPM project is to develop, implement, disseminate, and evaluate clinical decision support (CDS) in the area of chronic pain management. More specifically, AHRQ is interested in CDS that is delivered through both clinician- and patient-facing channels and is interoperable and publicly-shareable. This project is leveraging the CPG-on-FHIR work, the Opioid IG work, SMART, FHIR and related tools and technologies to implement these CDS artifacts in two health systems.
