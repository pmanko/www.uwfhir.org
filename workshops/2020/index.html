				<h3><br>
				For whom is this event intended?</h3>


				<p>We invite faculty, staff, students, administrators, and software developers from clinical, research, and public health disciplines to learn about the healthcare data standard FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), the related technologies of SMART and CDS Hooks, and their use in health informatics applications supporting both clinical care, research, and public health practice. Attendees will leave the conference with a foundational understanding for how to work within FHIR and an overview of how FHIR has been used to facilitate and manage healthcare innovation within healthcare organizations as well as research and public health settings.</p>


				<p>We invite our colleagues from across the country, but with a particular emphasis on the Pacific Northwest and Seattle. This meeting will be particularly useful to those from healthcare organizations, academia and research, public health, and our local start-up scene, and especially those in the roles of health informaticians, IT professionals, managers, and aspiring clinical informatics developers.</p>

			<div class='about-section' id='overview'>
				<h3>What is FHIR&#174; and why should I care?</h3>


				<p>Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources is a data standard for healthcare data developed by Health Level Seven International (HL7&#174;). Healthcare data that is stored using different formats and standards is a major problem facing healthcare organizations. The ability to share data between different organizations is limited; further, applications that work in one healthcare systems electronic health record (EHR) may not work in other organizations’ EHRs because of the differing data structures and standards.</p>


				<p>FHIR is proving to be the best attempt at developing a unify data standard that will allow interoperability between institutions for data sharing. The end goal is to enable the EHR as a platform, much like the Apple or Android app stores, where any application developed to use FHIR data can be downloaded and used on any EHR that has adopted FHIR.</p>


				<p>Closely related technologies such as SMART on FHIR and Clinical Quality Language (CQL) will also be discussed in the meeting and/or tutorials. SMART on FHIR is the set of tools that allow applications to be securely deployed inside of the EHR, enabling the “EHR as a platform” framework. Both web and native mobile apps can take advantage of single sign-on, patient context, user interface integration, and access to clinical data in the EHR. SMART on FHIR is the toolset you need to build extensions or apps within the EHR. CQL provides an ability to author both electronic clinical quality measures and clinical decision support logic. The promise is to have an EHR-independent way both to calculate on, and to reason on, clinical data, both in the moment to support the patient’s care, and retrospectively to improve measurement of health care delivery and outcomes.</p>

								<br>
								FHIR can help facilitate the entire data lifecycle (i.e., action to data to information to knowledge and back to action). This session will demonstrate this through two major initiatives that focus on various parts of the data lifecycle.  Adapting Clinical Guidelines for the Digital Age – developing computable knowledge through an agile, integrated process using the (Clinical Practice Guidelines) CPG-on-FHIR implementation guide. Making EHR Data More Available for Research and Public Health (MedMorph) – improving how to get data from different EHR systems without posing additional burden on health care providers through a reliable, scalable, generalizable, configurable, interoperable method (i.e., reference architecture) to get EHR data for multiple public health and research use cases<br><br>
							
								<b>FHIR in the Research Community</b><br>
								
								<a href="#seanM">Sean Mooney</a> Chief Research Information Officer,  University of Washington Medicine<br>
								<br>
								Researchers tell us that they need better integration with academic health systems for the purposes of investigational studies. I will discuss the importance of strategy around governance, resources and technical capability. I will also discuss how the UW is preparing to be more collaborative and supportive of investigators who are innovation leaders and require health system support to be successful. I'll touch on national efforts and raise a challenge to better support investigation and the opportunity.

							FHIR in electronic case reporting and COVID-19</b><br>
								<br>
								<b>eCR and COVID Reporting</b><br>
								<a href="#johnL">John Loonsk</a> Johns Hopkins University<br><br>
								At the start of COVID-19 electronic case reporting (eCR) had a compelling story, but only three trial implementations nationwide. Into this context, we began the “eCR Now” initiative. As a result, COVID-19 electronic case reporting is now operational in over 5000 healthcare sites nationally with more being added every week. The context for this explosive growth, the role of the eCR Now FHIR App, the eCR FHIR standards, the EHR FHIR API, and the needs of operationalizing a nationwide program in a time of standards transition will be discussed.

								<b>StayHome.app - a patient-centered, FHIR-native, COVID-19 app</b><br>
								<a href="#hannahB">Hannah Burkhardt</a>
								University of Washington<br><br>
								As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold and states experience the impacts of reopened economies, it is critical to efficiently manage new outbreaks through widespread testing and monitoring of both new and possible cases. Existing labor-intensive public health workflows may benefit from information collection directly from individuals through patient-reported outcomes (PROs) systems. We developed a reusable, mobile-friendly application for collecting PROs and experiences to support COVID-19 symptom self-monitoring and data sharing with appropriate public health agencies, using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) for interoperability.

								<b>Barriers to Adoption</b><br>
								<a href="#lauraHM">Laura Marcial</a> RTI<br><br>

								Shareable clinical decision support artifacts that leverage balloted and adopted FHIR resources (for instance, US Core or USCDI) are limited by the level of support provided (and conditions on access) to those FHIR resources in commercial EHRs. In addition, the current standards outlined by US Core and USCDI leave gaps, some more significant than others, that lead to challenges in implementation. EHR vendor support of FHIR services is variable in breadth, depth and quality, and bridging these gaps can sometimes be costly for customers. The ONC final rule has provided some motivation for EHR vendors to expand and update the FHIR support they provide for some data elements. We will discuss some challenges and recommendations focused on this gap between what is specified, what is allowed and what is implemented.<br><br>

This project is leveraging the CPG-on-FHIR work, the Opioid IG work, SMART, FHIR and related tools and technologies to implement these CDS artifacts in two health systems.<br>

							Bill enjoys applying his clinical and technology expertise to address information management problems in clinical care, public health, and global health. And, he likes building systems that are used both within academics, to understand and evaluate new approaches and methods, and outside of academics, to deliver real world value. He received his MD/MS from the University of California, San Francisco and Berkeley. He completed a residency in Emergency Medicine at the University of Arizona, and the Royal Brisbane Hospital, Queensland, Australia, after which he joined the faculty of Emergency Medicine at University of Washington. With an NIH “mid-career” fellowship he found his way back to a 20 year research career in Applied Medical Informatics. Currently he is a Professor in Health Informatics and Global Health, jointly appointed in UW’s Schools of Nursing, Medicine, and Public Health, and directs the UW Clinical Informatics Research Group, <a href="https://cirg.washington.edu">cirg.washington.edu</a>. Bill appreciates John's comments, below, and reciprocates, noting that it's convenient that we're adjacent alphabetically. And that few people read bios.

							<td class='agenda-detail text-left'>My aim is to improve health by helping patients, healthcare professionals, and researchers leverage software engineering and informatics.  Much of my work is focused on engineering details, but I endeavor to understand the larger context of individual-driven health, clinical care, research, and population health - I'd like to address problems with tech appropriately, not amplify them. I've been a technical program manager with the University of Washington's <a href="https://cirg.washington.edu">Clinical Informatics Research Group</a> for the past dozen or so years, wearing many hats: team lead, engineer, designer, informaticist, budget and proposal developer, compliance officer, and perhaps most importantly, translator between engineers and stakeholders!  Much of my work is focused on individual-driven (consumer) health, and patient engagement in clinical care; I've built many variations of "patient reported outcomes" systems (eg https://paintracker.uwmedicine.org ), and tools (health interventions) based on them to help individuals and clinicians (eg https://p3p4me.org and https://us.truenth.org ).  Other key projects of mine include large scale data integrations (community health, HIV research, and syndromic surveillance of influenza), and diagnosis adjudication platforms.  Systems interfacing is a goal common to most of my projects; my current toolset there includes FHIR and SMART on FHIR, and more established tech like HL7 v2 and CCDA.  I'm excited by patient/consumer-directed initiatives such as openmhealth.org and carinalliance.com.
